To convert code that uses `torch_xla` (which is designed for TPUs) to work without a TPU, you need to replace `torch_xla` components with their equivalent `torch` (PyTorch) counterparts. The conversion generally involves:

1. **Removing `torch_xla` imports** and replacing them with `torch` or standard Python libraries.
2. **Replacing XLA model functions** (`xm`) with corresponding PyTorch functions.
3. **Handling multiprocessing** and **parallel data loading** using PyTorch's built-in utilities.

Here’s how you can adjust the imports and structure:

### Original Code Using `torch_xla`
```python
import torch_xla.core
import torch_xla.core.functions
import torch_xla.core.xla_model as xm
import torch_xla.distributed.xla_multiprocessing as xmp
import torch_xla.distributed.parallel_loader as pl
```

### Converted Code for CPU/GPU (Without TPU)
```python
import torch
import torch.nn as nn
import torch.multiprocessing as mp
from torch.utils.data import DataLoader
from torch.utils.data.distributed import DistributedSampler
```

### Replace `torch_xla` Specific Operations

1. **Model and Device Handling**:

   - Replace `xm.xla_device()` (which gets the TPU device) with `torch.device('cuda')` for GPU or `torch.device('cpu')` for CPU.

   ```python
   device = torch.device('cuda' if torch.cuda.is_available() else 'cpu')
   model.to(device)
   ```

2. **Distributed and Parallel Processing**:

   - Replace `xmp.spawn` (used for spawning processes across multiple TPU cores) with PyTorch's `mp.spawn` if you're doing multiprocessing on CPUs/GPUs.

   ```python
   def train(rank, world_size):
       # Your training code here
       pass

   if __name__ == "__main__":
       world_size = 4  # or whatever is appropriate
       mp.spawn(train, args=(world_size,), nprocs=world_size, join=True)
   ```

3. **Data Loading**:

   - Replace `pl.ParallelLoader` with a standard PyTorch `DataLoader`. If you're using distributed training, use `DistributedSampler`.

   ```python
   train_sampler = DistributedSampler(train_dataset)  # If using distributed training
   train_loader = DataLoader(train_dataset, batch_size=batch_size, sampler=train_sampler)
   ```

4. **Training Loop Adjustments**:

   - Adjust any XLA-specific optimizations or functions to their PyTorch equivalents.

### Example Replacement:
If your original code had something like this:
```python
device = xm.xla_device()
model.to(device)

# Loading data
train_loader = pl.ParallelLoader(train_dataset, [device]).per_device_loader(device)

# Training step
optimizer.zero_grad()
output = model(data)
loss = criterion(output, target)
loss.backward()
xm.optimizer_step(optimizer)
```

Convert it to:
```python
device = torch.device('cuda' if torch.cuda.is_available() else 'cpu')
model.to(device)

# Loading data
train_loader = DataLoader(train_dataset, batch_size=batch_size, shuffle=True)

# Training step
optimizer.zero_grad()
output = model(data.to(device))
loss = criterion(output, target.to(device))
loss.backward()
optimizer.step()
```

### Summary

This conversion process makes your code work on standard CPUs/GPUs using PyTorch’s native functionality. The actual logic of your model training, evaluation, and data handling will stay largely the same, but you'll swap out the TPU-specific tools with more general PyTorch tools.
